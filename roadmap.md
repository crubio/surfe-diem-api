Suggestions to Make the App More Pythonic, Robust, and Concise
1. Leverage Pydantic and Dataclasses for Data Models
Use Pydantic models (or Python dataclasses) for internal data handling, not just for FastAPI schemas.
Reduces boilerplate and improves validation and type safety.
Example: Classes like SpotLocation can be dataclasses or Pydantic models.
2. Consistent and Specific Exception Handling
Catch specific exceptions (e.g., IntegrityError for DB issues) instead of generic except:.
Provide meaningful error messages.
Use FastAPI’s exception handlers for global error handling.
3. Type Annotations Everywhere
Add type hints to all function signatures, especially for route handlers and utility functions.
Improves readability and tooling support.
4. GeoJSON Coordinate Order
Ensure all GeoJSON outputs use [longitude, latitude] order, not [latitude, longitude].
5. Database Models: Use Correct Types
Use Float for latitude/longitude fields in SQLAlchemy models instead of String.
6. Reduce Repetition in Routers
Use dependency injection for repeated logic (e.g., user authentication, DB session).
Consider FastAPI’s APIRouter dependencies for shared logic.
7. Utility Functions: Use Modern Libraries
For password hashing, use pwd_context.hash(password) instead of deprecated methods.
Use httpx.AsyncClient and async endpoints for I/O-bound routes.
8. Configuration Management
Use environment variables and Pydantic’s BaseSettings for all configuration.
Centralize config access.
9. Validation and Error Messages
Validate incoming data with Pydantic schemas, not just in the DB layer.
Return consistent, user-friendly error messages.
10. Testing and Linting
Ensure you have automated tests (unit and integration).
Use tools like black, isort, and flake8 for code formatting and linting.
11. General Pythonic Practices
Use list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate.
Prefer unpacking and direct assignment over manual loops for simple transformations.
Use logging instead of print statements for error reporting.
12. Documentation
Add docstrings to all public functions, classes, and modules.
Use FastAPI’s built-in OpenAPI docs for API documentation.
